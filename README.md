# Dungeon Master Visualizer 
This is my second project for Per Scholas. The challenge was to utilize React and an API. I followed my inner nerd and went with SketchFab with FreeSound to make a "scene compositor" for D&D roleplayed.  

**Deployment**
[Live on Netlify](https://master--euphonious-mooncake-53c4ad.netlify.app/)

**How I worked on this project:**

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I attempted to use branches and pull requests to better understand the Git architecture.
- I built this app with Redux, Router, localStorage and MUI to better under a complex implantation of states.
- I combined two APIs to produce a single “scene”

**Why I built the project**

- I have a background in compositing audio and video so this was an experiment at doing that with code. SketchFab and FreeSound API’s alone would not have been much of a challenge. Though together they gave me a lot of inspiration.
- My desire for this project is to develop in a way that it gets me close to a professional work flow using branches in GitHub, referencing MUI’s component library layout and interactions.
- MUI got me up and running in a responsive environment quicker than just starting from vanilla JS and CSS.

**What I learned**

- Spending time determining a user flow would have saved me several hours. I had the APIs I wanted to use but I was letting their interactions drive the flow of my app. 
- Working with MUI; I did enjoy how quick it was to get smaller components ready and styled quickly however I found myself fighting the library when it came to larger complex comonents like the top app bar. About half way through the project I finally found the [pallet generator](https://m2.material.io/inline-tools/color/) and [theme creator](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/) which were increadably useful. 
- In the future I will strive to work on pure functionality first till all my needs are met then pursue UX/UI. I found my self getting distracted troubleshooting and exploring styling more than finishing the functionality.  

**Class MVP requirements**

- Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript using the React Library
- Hosted on CodeSandbox, Netlify or GitHub Pages
- Frequent Commits to GitHub
- A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Use `Fetch` and `UseEffect` to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi and insert some of the data retrieved into your State and display it on the screen

**Stretch Features**

- Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc.
- Look into [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so you can save data to the user's browser
- Utilize Redux or the Context API
